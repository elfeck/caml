\begin{abstract}
  Datasets with large size and high-dimensional data pose a challenge even
  with steadily growing computational power. To tackle large datasets and
  high dimensionality sparse grids can be employed. Due to sparseness and spatial
  adaptivity, high-dimensional and difficult functions can be modeled.
  By modifying least squares estimation, adaptive sparse grid can be
  applied to classification and regression with good results in artificial
  and real-world data mining scenarios. Results for the checker-board datasets and a difficult regression task confirm that. 
  Although efficient an implementation is challenging, sparse grids can make use of and benefit from modern hardware features like
  parallelization and vectorization.
