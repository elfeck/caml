\section{Implementation of Sparse Grids}
Many real-world problems require a large number grid points as mentioned in
Sec.~\ref{subsec:test}. Together with an enormous number of data points and
high dimensionality, a lot of raw computational power is required. To keep
the required time and cost as low as possible an efficient implementation of
sparse grids is essential. Modern hardware offers many features to parallelize
and vectorize computation
